# Decision 005: Orchestrator Is An Ask-Activated Semantic Dispatcher

Date: 2026-06-24

Status: Accepted

## Context

The workflow needs an orchestrator that can slice execution-ready plans into
bounded work items, select a small execution-node topology, dispatch work, and
aggregate results. The tempting design is to make this role a powerful manager
that can start, stop, and reshape agents directly.

That would violate the current state model. Runtime authority belongs to CC_BRIDGE
scripts, `loop_runner`, and cc-bridge-daemon/reload surfaces. CC_BRIDGE already has explicit
reload support for safe additive load and idle unload, but this is guarded
runtime behavior, not a semantic agent permission.

## Decision

Make `orchestrator` an ask-activated semantic dispatcher.

It is activated by `loop_runner` for one loop round or orchestration batch. It
may analyze task complexity, choose 1-4 execution nodes, produce work items and
dependency graphs, generate constrained `ask` payloads for worker/reviewer
roles, propose a runtime workflow graph, freeze failed branches, drain
unaffected work, and aggregate node results.

It must not directly modify `.cc-bridge/cc-bridge.config`, invoke `cc_bridge reload`, kill panes,
write `.cc-bridge/runtime/loops` authority files, lower acceptance criteria, or mark
partial work as done.

Dynamic agent load/unload is represented as a topology proposal from
orchestrator to CC_BRIDGE scripts. Loop runner and CC_BRIDGE-owned scripts validate and
commit the desired topology, then the topology reconciler decides whether
existing agents are enough, whether new dynamic agents must be ensured,
whether layout/lifecycle changes can safely apply, or whether the proposal must
be rejected.

## Consequences

- Orchestrator stays short-lived and context-bounded.
- Runtime mutation remains deterministic and auditable.
- Current CC_BRIDGE hot-reload capability can be reused later without making it a
  semantic-agent permission.
- V1 can start with fixed configured worker/reviewer agents or explicit
  topology reconciliation.
- The Role Pack should focus on work slicing, dependency graphs, constrained
  asks, topology proposal artifacts, and aggregation templates.

## Non-Goals

- This does not implement dynamic temporary agents in v1.
- This does not make orchestrator a daemon.
- This does not give orchestrator direct reload/kill authority.
- This does not remove support for loop-runner or reconciler-mediated dynamic
  load and idle unload.
