# Phase 1-6 Evidence Index

Date: 2026-07-05
Status: ACTIVE INDEX / FINAL PHASE 1-6 ACCEPTANCE RECORDED

## Purpose

This file indexes accepted reviews, checklist-only artifacts, planning inputs,
runtime B7 evidence, and remaining non-production follow-up gates for the
Phase 1-6 acceptance goal. It is a navigation aid for the final acceptance
report. Phase 6A is claimable for the fake-provider program-matrix scope, and
Phase 6B is claimable for the initial real-provider, single-round capability
scope after the 2026-07-05 `talk2` final aggregation review.

| Phase 6B matrix `release_incomplete` classification repair | Accepted implementation/readiness repair only; not launch approval or Phase 6B readiness | Worker2/follow-up: `job_692502f50c7d`, `job_3fd8ef33538c`; reviewer1 direct audit: `/home/bfly/yunwei/cc-bridge_source/.cc-bridge/cc-bridge-daemon/artifacts/text/completion-reply/job_ebe46ce6cd8b-art_c895cae3d4ac466f.txt`; accepted behavior: `release_incomplete_agents` plus bounded `release_blockers` classifies as `valid_non_success`, while missing/vague/unbounded evidence remains a hard failure. |
| Phase 6B L1-L4 launch preparation | Accepted as planning/readiness prep only; not L1-L4 launch approval or Phase 6B readiness | Worker3: `job_5c007d3bab56`; reviewer1 acceptance: `/home/bfly/yunwei/cc-bridge_source/.cc-bridge/cc-bridge-daemon/artifacts/text/completion-reply/job_b9eac0af0f9e-art_973372060e54411a.txt`; planning package: [phase6b-l1-l4-launch-prep.md](../topics/phase6b-l1-l4-launch-prep.md) |

Residual before any future approval-to-run: emit `authority_checks.*` booleans. |
| Phase 6B L5 reviewer-rework/partial tranche | Accepted as plan-only readiness packet; no approval-to-run and not Phase 6B readiness | Worker2 callback: `job_e6456cf4a072`; reviewer2 acceptance: `/home/bfly/yunwei/cc-bridge_source/.cc-bridge/cc-bridge-daemon/artifacts/text/completion-reply/job_3824dde8454e-art_f877efe2b9434c4f.txt`; packet: [phase6b-reviewer-rework-partial-observation-tranche.md](../topics/phase6b-reviewer-rework-partial-observation-tranche.md); result: bounded partial and reviewer-rework candidates are defined, but future launch request still needs exact root, command shape, executable normalizer, and approval-to-run. |
| Phase 6B active-lane coverage audit | `COVERAGE OK`; read-only audit, not launch approval or Phase 6B readiness | Reviewer1: `/home/bfly/yunwei/cc-bridge_source/.cc-bridge/cc-bridge-daemon/artifacts/text/completion-reply/job_34d57ea11c3a-art_6d7184feba4b4dce.txt`; result: no missing Phase 6B acceptance-goal requirement in the coverage matrix or active lanes; later worker1 and worker2 plan-only lanes are accepted, leaving runtime evidence and normalizer/launch-packet hardening as the next gates. |
| Phase 6B L1-L4 repeat12 real-provider evidence | Claimable L1-L4 evidence for final Phase 6B aggregation | User changed the final launch-review gate to `talk2` self-review on 2026-07-05. Sequence12 was consumed exactly once from `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/phase6-real-lab-l1-l4-sequence12-20260705`. B7: [phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-repeat12-b7-20260705.md](phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-repeat12-b7-20260705.md), `Status: pass`, five rows, all `claimable_row=true`; cleanup returned `kill_status: ok`, `state: unmounted`. |

| Phase 6B final aggregation | Accepted by `talk2` owner/supervisor review per user instruction; not an independent reviewer verdict | [phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260705.md](phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260705.md); scope is initial real-provider single-round capability only, with production/default enablement and final source-control packaging still pending. |
| Deployment readiness P1 dynamic lifecycle | Pass for current source tree; not final deployment-readiness report | [phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p1-dynamic-lifecycle-20260708.md](phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p1-dynamic-lifecycle-20260708.md); raw B7: `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/deploy-p1-dynamic-lifecycle-talk2-20260708161320/p1-dynamic-lifecycle-b7.md`; covers real-project dynamic release, busy-retain, resident UI/sidebar visibility, and explicit observer timeout. |
| Deployment readiness P2 frontdesk pressure | Pass for current source tree; not final deployment-readiness report | [phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p2-frontdesk-pressure-20260708.md](phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p2-frontdesk-pressure-20260708.md); raw B7: `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/deploy-p2-frontdesk-pressure-talk2-20260708170920/phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-p2-frontdesk-pressure-talk2-20260708170920-b7.md`; covers one visible frontdesk macro-intake that produced five route-mix tasks, exactly one planner handoff marker, no frontdesk direct implementation, two clean direct-execution dynamic releases, and valid non-success classifications for detail/macro/blocked. |
| Deployment readiness P3 module-level audit | `PASS_WITH_LIMITS`; not final deployment-readiness report | [phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p3-module-audit-20260708.md](phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p3-module-audit-20260708.md); audits the six Phase 1-6 modules against current P0/P1/P2 direct evidence, with bounded historical supplement for L5 partial and Phase 6A reviewer-rework. Carries explicit limits for reviewer-rework stability, full live ask-failure injection, complete park/resume rerun coverage, five independent frontdesk messages, and P5 packaging. |
| Deployment readiness final report | Report complete; P5 source gate passed; release not published; production/default not enabled | [phase1-6-deployment-readiness-report-20260708.md](phase1-6-deployment-readiness-report-20260708.md); summarizes sequence38, P1, P2, P3, P5, module verdicts, failure taxonomy, first stable L5 partial breakpoint, unresolved blockers, non-goals, and package-owner release priorities. |
| Deployment readiness P4 post-fix fullflow retest | Pass for current source tree; strengthens P4 operator-facing evidence | Raw B7: `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/deploy-fullflow-talk2-selfrun-20260708202901/phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-deploy-fullflow-talk2-selfrun-20260708202901-b7.md`; covers frontdesk -> planner -> L1/L2 direct execution -> reviewer -> round reviewer, task_detailer `controller_expected_stop: detail_ready`, macro/blocker terminal routes, clean dynamic release for both direct loops, and post-B7 process cleanup. |
| Deployment readiness P5 source packaging gate | Source packaging gate pass; release not published; production/default not enabled | [phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p5-packaging-gate-20260708.md](phase1-6-deployment-readiness-p5-packaging-gate-20260708.md); records the command-surface/fake-provider and fake-worker workspace-promotion fixes, source-wrapper smoke `workflow_smoke_status=ok`, broad source bundle `322 passed`, `npm pack --dry-run`, project/local-prefix and global-prefix skip-download npm install smoke, and remaining package-owner release boundary. |
| Deployment readiness P5 post-gate automatic frontdesk stress | Pass for current source tree; automatic frontdesk/planner/auto-runner path observed | Raw B7: `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/deploy-stress-talk2-selfrun-20260708205921/phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-deploy-stress-talk2-selfrun-20260708205921-b7.md`; rows: `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/deploy-stress-talk2-selfrun-20260708205921/rows/phase6b_l1_l4_deploy-stress-talk2-selfrun-20260708205921_evidence_rows.jsonl`; result: `Status: pass`, five claimable rows, L1/L2 `done/pass` with clean dynamic release, L3 `detail_ready`, L4 macro `replan_required`, L4 blocked `blocked`, post-B7 cleanup clean. |
| Deployment readiness P5 repeatability fullflow | Pass for current source tree; confirms automatic route-mix repeatability | Raw B7: `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/deploy-repeatability-talk2-202607082126/phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-deploy-repeatability-talk2-202607082126-b7.md`; summary: `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/deploy-repeatability-talk2-202607082126/repeatability-summary.json`; result: five claimable rows, two pass rows, three valid-non-success rows, L1/L2 clean dynamic release, no post-cleanup process residue. |
| Real npm latest install smoke | Public release install path works for `@seemseam/cc-bridge@8.0.19`; not proof of current dirty source publication | `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/p5-real-npm-install-talk2-20260708212535/real-npm-install-result.json`; installed package `8.0.19`, `cc-bridge --print-version` -> `v8.0.19`, release vendor payload present, all bin links present. Current checkout `package.json` remains `8.0.14`, so package-owner release/version reconciliation remains open. |
| Current-source preview release install smoke | Local release-shaped artifact/install path works for dirty-source preview `8.0.14`; not an official publish | `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/p5-current-source-release-talk2-202607082205/current-source-release-install-result.json`; artifact `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/p5-current-source-release-talk2-202607082205/dist/cc-bridge-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, size `32M`, sha256 `4454560c3e846cbc475fa05ab289e47e0cd7417a19f5cb18f0151ebcdee4af23`, install metadata `install_mode=release`, `source_kind=preview`, bin links and release helpers present. This run exposed and fixed generated mobile build/cache pollution in `scripts/build_release.py`. |
| Installed-preview workflow closure smoke | Installed current-source preview artifact can run deterministic workflow closure from test folder | `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/p5-current-source-release-talk2-202607082205/installed-preview-workflow-smoke-result.json`; project root `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/p5-installed-preview-smoke-talk2-202607082220`; used the installed artifact's own `scripts/workflow_closure_smoke.py` and `cc_bridge_test`; result `workflow_smoke_status=ok`, final `done`, round `pass`, release `released_count=2`, `retained_count=0`, cleanup return code 0, no target-project process residue in follow-up scan. |

## Phase 6A Program-Matrix Claim Boundary

- `smoke-busy-release` single-case runner is accepted in reviewer1
  `job_7fb1ad254939`; B1 from `job_d9820cc82c80` is closed.
- The post-lifecycle acceptance sequence and matrix sequencing are captured in
  the Phase 6A closure runbook:
  [topics/phase6a-fake-provider-matrix-closure-runbook.md](../topics/phase6a-fake-provider-matrix-closure-runbook.md).
  The same runbook now records the integrated matrix command and residue
  hardening gap.
- The full eight-case fake-provider source-wrapper matrix produced a
  residue-clean script-level pass at
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/phase6-final-matrix-20260704-final-report/phase6_fake_matrix_report.json`:
  all eight cases observed, no hard failures, `phase6a_pass=true`, and all
  three runtime residue booleans true on every row.
- Worker3 `job_9ee0c28fa49e` closed the null residue-field gap. Worker3
  `job_9fff172b9685` cleaned the generated Markdown report wording.
- Reviewer1 accepted the residue-clean matrix package in `job_712002b8f005`.
  Reviewer2 accepted the module/final-report evidence package and Phase 6A
  claim boundary in `job_a34e79ecfc00`.
- Phase 6A is claimable only for the fake-provider, single-round,
  source-wrapper program-matrix scope. It does not claim Phase 6B,
  real-provider capability, production/default enablement, long-running
  multi-round workflows, or arbitrary workflow authoring.
- Dated final report:
  [phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260704.md](phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260704.md).
- Final source-control packaging policy is recorded in
  [topics/phase1-6-final-packaging-hygiene.md](../topics/phase1-6-final-packaging-hygiene.md):
  `dist/` and `dist-mobile/` are ignored, Satinoos tracks source plus selected
  PNG/PDF outputs, `claude_pane.py` is deferred to managed-provider
  reliability, and reviewed shared README/topic edits are included as Phase 1-6
  / Decision 020 context. Worker2 formalized this in `job_ac6140294b18`;
  reviewer2 accepted
  it as final packaging hygiene guidance in `job_08484caac091`. Worker3
  prepared a dry-run staging manifest in `job_568d08f32ff4`, and reviewer2
  accepted it for human package-owner staging review in `job_6e27efd2bf13`.
  Worker3 then tightened the broad dry-run command paths in
  `job_cd066f5d6147`. Reviewer2 accepted the tightened manifest for human
  package-owner final staging review in `job_055a5e798708`, with no
  blocker/high/medium issues. A later local refresh updated the manifest to
  the current 61-entry status, added ignored `dist/` beside `dist-mobile/`,
  and included the Phase 6B L0 owner-decision packet as planning/readiness
  material; reviewer2 accepted the refreshed inventory in
  `job_2f61849ef1a4`.
  Final human staging or package execution is still pending. This is a
  packaging state update, not a Phase 6A runtime verdict.

## Phase 6B Status

Phase 6B is claimable for the initial real-provider, single-round capability
scope after the 2026-07-05 `talk2` final aggregation review:

- L0 runtime sanity is covered by
  [phase6b-real-provider-l0-b-only-repeat6-b7-20260704.md](phase6b-real-provider-l0-b-only-repeat6-b7-20260704.md),
  `Status: pass`.
- L1/L2 direct execution, L3 `needs_detail`, L4
  `macro_adjustment_request`, and L4 `blocked` are covered by
  [phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-repeat12-b7-20260705.md](phase6b-real-provider-l1-l4-repeat12-b7-20260705.md),
  `Status: pass`, with all five rows claimable.
- The reviewer-rework-or-partial requirement is satisfied by partial
  observation in
  [phase6b-real-provider-l5-partial-repeat4-b7-20260704.md](phase6b-real-provider-l5-partial-repeat4-b7-20260704.md),
  `Status: valid_non_success` and
  `reviewer_rework_or_partial_observed=true`.
- The final aggregation decision is recorded in
  [phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260705.md](phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260705.md).

The accepted Phase 6B scope remains bounded. It does not enable production by
default, prove long-running multi-round workflows, prove post-detail execution,
or prove reviewer-rework convergence. Repeat6, sequence12, and L5 repeat4 are
consumed evidence roots and must not be reused. Any future real-provider lab
run must use a new root and a new explicit owner/supervisor launch decision.
