# CC_BRIDGE Adapter Notes For Planner

Use reply-visible artifacts as the durable boundary. Prefer producing
`task-packet.md`, `readiness.json`, and `candidate-questions.jsonl` sections for
the supervisor/runner to import or review.

The active command surface is closed. Do not run shell commands, file searches,
file reads, tests, builds, or CC_BRIDGE commands from the provider session. Base your
reply on the Frontdesk-authored intake, compact artifacts, and prompt context.
Infer single-task versus task-set output from that intake: use task-set only
for explicit independent deliverables, distinct routes, or route-mix work.

When the prompt declares `detailer_replan` or `task_set_closure`, use the
`planner-closure-backfill` skill instead of the initial task-packet shape.
Return exactly one parser-stable `**planner-backfill.json**` fenced proposal.
Its `schema` is exactly `cc-bridge.planner.backfill_proposal.v1`, its `mode` is the
exact declared activation mode, and it contains the complete structured
Frontdesk status envelope. The host validates the expected PlanTree revision
and performs every file write or Frontdesk delivery.

For `detailer_replan`, copy the controller authority, task identity and task
revision, and supplied Detailer macro-adjustment evidence exactly. Preserve
accepted facts, then return a complete replacement macro proposal that
invalidates the old orchestration semantics. Its mode must be exactly
`detailer_replan`; never emit `task_set_closure` for that activation.

For `task_set_closure`, the expected PlanTree revision is a digest-valued fence
and the mode is exactly `task_set_closure`. Retain the aggregate, closure, and
Frontdesk-status rules. Do not run wait/watch commands, notify Frontdesk, or
target any agent. The provider reply is evidence only.

For initial intake only (when neither backfill activation is declared), the
supervisor/runner imports exact `**task-packet.md**` and `**readiness.json**`
fenced sections. Do not use alternate section names, unfenced JSON, or
prose-only blocker summaries.

Never run `cc_bridge plan task-create`, `cc_bridge plan task-artifact`, `cc_bridge plan
task-status`, `cc_bridge plan breadcrumb`, `cc_bridge loop`, `cc_bridge ask`, `cc_bridge_test`, or
wrapper commands from the provider session. Those commands mutate or route
authority and are owned by the supervisor/runner script, not planner.

Never edit `.cc-bridge/runtime`, `.cc-bridge/agents`, `current_loop`, lease, socket, pid,
mailbox, pane, provider-state, or tmux state files directly.
