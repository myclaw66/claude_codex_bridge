# Workflow Role Catalog And Boundaries

Date: 2026-06-27

## Purpose

Define the role catalog needed by the CC_BRIDGE agentic workflow before converting
the roles into Agent Roles specs.

This document follows the current architecture in
[architecture.md](architecture.md) and the Chinese workflow overview in
[agentic-workflow-scheme.zh.md](agentic-workflow-scheme.zh.md).

This document records the current CC_BRIDGE workflow role catalog. CC_BRIDGE-specific
workflow roles keep explicit `agentroles.cc-bridge_*` ids; generic execution roles
such as `agentroles.coder` and `agentroles.code_reviewer` remain portable
host-neutral roles. Role Collections group installation, update, removal, list
hierarchy, and profiles, but they do not define runtime topology, inheritance,
or permissions.

The design principle remains:

```text
program kernel stays simple and stable
semantic flexibility belongs to roles
scripts commit or reject role artifacts
```

Roles should not be designed as one omnipotent main agent. Each role should
hold only the context required for its phase, produce explicit artifacts, and
respect script-owned authority.

The context-lifecycle split is part of the role boundary:

- `frontdesk` and `planner` are the only intended long-lived conversation
  holders.
- `frontdesk` keeps user-facing intake, preferences, confirmations, and
  escalation breadcrumbs, not implementation detail.
- `planner` keeps macro plan-tree state, the compact brief, roadmap/TODO,
  decisions, open questions, and stable evidence links.
- `orchestrator`, `task_detailer`, workers, reviewers, and round reviewers are
  immaculate (`无垢`) roles. They may be mounted or visible for observability,
  but each semantic activation must be fresh and rehydrated from durable
  artifacts, not old conversation memory.

## Role Design Tiers

### V1 Core RolePacks

These roles define the mainline CC_BRIDGE workflow surface. CC_BRIDGE-specific workflow
roles use `agentroles.cc-bridge_*`; execution implementation/review roles stay
generic where they are useful outside CC_BRIDGE.

| RolePack | Default Agent | Lifetime | Main Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_frontdesk` | `cc-bridge_frontdesk` | long-lived / user-facing | macro task intake, user-facing summary, escalation display |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_task_detailer` | `cc-bridge_task_detailer` | V1 visible / immaculate task-scoped activation | task-scoped detail docs, detailed execution packet, source-evidence map, task-local clarification artifacts, stable summary backfill |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_planner` | `cc-bridge_planner` | long-lived or phase-activated | macro task packet, plan-tree brief, readiness recommendation, macro adjustment review |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_orchestrator` | `cc-bridge_orchestrator` | V1 visible / immaculate task-round activation | triage result, optional detailer request, node plan, constrained task dispatch, round aggregation |
| `agentroles.coder` | `coder` | immaculate per work item | bounded implementation or investigation result |
| `agentroles.code_reviewer` | `code_reviewer` | immaculate per work item | node verification, fallback audit, pass/rework/block decision |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_round_reviewer` | `cc-bridge_round_reviewer` | immaculate per execution round | round result report: `pass`, `partial`, `replan_required`, or `global_blocker` |

### V1 Optional Or On-Demand RolePacks

These roles are installable capabilities but not required members of the core
planning path.

| RolePack | Default Agent | Trigger | Main Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| future CC_BRIDGE plan reviewer | `cc-bridge_plan_reviewer` | macro or detail readiness review is requested | planner/detail quality review and readiness/blocker findings |
| future CC_BRIDGE clarification broker | `cc-bridge_clarification_broker` | macro questions require user-facing filtering | user-question artifact, defaults, deferred questions, normalized answers |

### V1 Script/Hybrid Roles

These are part of the workflow architecture but should not initially become
heavy semantic RolePacks.

| Role | Form | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `loop_runner` | CC_BRIDGE program/helper | Owns deterministic routing, locks, leases, status edges, and one-shot activation. It must not become an agent conversation. |
| plan stewardship | deterministic `cc_bridge plan` first, optional `planner` work mode later | Script commands own authoritative task/index/status writes. Planner may summarize or audit plan-tree consistency, but cannot bypass scripts. |
| `runtime_layout_manager` | CC_BRIDGE program/helper | Owns tmux window/pane placement. Semantic roles request capacity; they do not mutate panes directly. |

### V1 Role Collections

Collections are Agent Roles catalog and install-management artifacts. They are
not parent Roles, source merges, permission grants, or runtime topology.

| Collection | Required Members | Optional Members | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `agentroles.collections.planning_group` | `agentroles.cc-bridge_planner` | future CC_BRIDGE plan-review or clarification roles | Install the macro planner and optional planning-adjacent capabilities without merging their contexts. |
| `agentroles.collections.execution_workgroup` | `agentroles.coder`, `agentroles.code_reviewer` | doc, research, test, and source-reviewer Roles | Install the default bounded implementation and independent review Roles. |
| `agentroles.collections.agentic_loop_core` | `agentroles.cc-bridge_frontdesk`, `agentroles.cc-bridge_task_detailer`, `agentroles.cc-bridge_planner`, `agentroles.cc-bridge_orchestrator`, `agentroles.coder`, `agentroles.code_reviewer`, `agentroles.cc-bridge_round_reviewer` | future review/risk/monitor/recovery roles | Install the core workflow Role set for CC_BRIDGE-like agentic loops. |

CC_BRIDGE runtime topology may still use `planning_group`, `execution_group`, and
`workgroup-node1` as Project Binding or runtime-state concepts. Those runtime
groups do not derive membership, authority, or mounting behavior from
Collections. Orchestrator and topology policy must explicitly declare concrete
members, roles, profiles, edges, gates, lifecycle, and release policy.

### V2 Optional RolePacks

These should be designed after V1 loop closure is proven.

| RolePack | Default Agent | Trigger | Main Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_risk_reviewer` | `risk_reviewer` | destructive, release, migration, credential, or broad-runtime changes | risk gate and required approvals |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_inner_monitor` | `inner_monitor` | long-running or anomalous loop | health report and escalation recommendation |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_recovery` | `recovery` | provider/ask/tmux/lease failure | recovery plan or blocked evidence package |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_plan_steward` | `planner` work mode | legacy compatibility only | low-noise plan-tree sync summary |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_domain_researcher` | `domain_researcher` | planner lacks domain evidence | source-backed research brief |
| `agentroles.cc-bridge_spec_checker` | `spec_checker` | public contract or RolePack/spec changes | spec conformance report |

- change product scope;
- directly write task status;
- infer success without evidence;

- round verification plan;
- round result report with a standalone machine line:
  `round result: pass|partial|replan_required|global_blocker`;
- evidence reference checklist;
- hidden degradation audit.

## Script Boundary Required In Every RolePack

Every CC_BRIDGE workflow RolePack should include a common CC_BRIDGE authority rule:

```text
You may author semantic artifacts and recommend transitions.
You must not directly edit authoritative state:
- task index
- task status
- current_loop
- leases or locks
- runtime capacity records
- tmux pane/window state

Use CC_BRIDGE commands such as `cc_bridge plan`, `cc_bridge loop`, `cc_bridge question`, or the
provided skill wrappers for authoritative writes.
```

## Design Requirements For Mother

When `mother` designs these RolePacks, it should produce for each V1 role:

- role id and default local agent name;
- identity and mission;
- authority and non-authority;
- required inputs;
- expected outputs and artifact schemas;
- required skills;
- reusable templates;
- negative instructions;
- CC_BRIDGE script boundary text;
- minimal smoke-test scenario;
- compatibility notes for CC_BRIDGE visible agents and future non-CC_BRIDGE hosts.

The first external Agent Roles spec pass should focus on:

1. `agentroles.cc-bridge_planner`
2. `agentroles.cc-bridge_orchestrator`
3. `agentroles.coder`
4. `agentroles.code_reviewer`
5. `agentroles.cc-bridge_round_reviewer`
6. `agentroles.collections.planning_group`
7. `agentroles.collections.execution_workgroup`
8. `agentroles.collections.agentic_loop_core`
9. optional `agentroles.cc-bridge_task_detailer`
10. future CC_BRIDGE plan-review and clarification roles if still needed

`agentroles.cc-bridge_frontdesk`, optional worker specialties, optional reviewer
specialties, monitor, recovery, and risk reviewer can follow after the core
closure path is stable.

## Mother Design Review

The first `mother` RolePack design pass was completed on 2026-06-27 and is
recorded in
[../history/mother-rolepack-design-2026-06-27.md](../history/mother-rolepack-design-2026-06-27.md).

Accepted refinements:

- Treat `planner`, `plan_reviewer`, `clarification_broker`, `orchestrator`,
  and `round_checker` as P0 complete RolePack work.
- Treat `frontdesk`, `worker`, and `checker` as P1 simplified reference roles.
- Keep monitor, recovery, risk, planner stewardship mode, domain researcher,
  and spec checker as P2 boundary-only roles until V1 loop closure is stable.
- Require a shared authority rule in every CC_BRIDGE workflow RolePack.
- Split host-neutral RolePack content from CC_BRIDGE adapter-specific command,
  runtime, tmux, ask/callback, lease, and capacity details.

Immediate external Agent Roles spec handoff order:

1. common authority rule and artifact templates;
2. `agentroles.cc-bridge_planner` as the macro planner, with
   `agentroles.cc-bridge_task_detailer` as an orchestrator-demanded optional
   refinement role;
3. `agentroles.collections.planning_group`;
4. `agentroles.cc-bridge_round_reviewer`;
5. tightened `agentroles.cc-bridge_orchestrator`;
6. future CC_BRIDGE clarification or plan-review roles only if the V1 loop proves
   they are needed;
7. `agentroles.collections.execution_workgroup`;
8. simplified `agentroles.cc-bridge_frontdesk`, `agentroles.coder`, and
   `agentroles.code_reviewer`;
9. `agentroles.collections.agentic_loop_core`.

## Draft Landing Status

The first CC_BRIDGE workflow RolePack draft set is now present under
`drafts/`:

- `_shared/authority-rule.md` and `_shared/templates/*`;
- `agentroles.cc-bridge_planner`;
- `agentroles.cc-bridge_task_detailer`;
- `agentroles.cc-bridge_plan_reviewer`;
- `agentroles.cc-bridge_clarification_broker`;
- `agentroles.cc-bridge_orchestrator`;
- `agentroles.cc-bridge_frontdesk`;
- `agentroles.coder`;
- `agentroles.code_reviewer`;
- `agentroles.cc-bridge_round_reviewer`;
- legacy compatibility/history packages:
  `agentroles.cc-bridge_worker`, `agentroles.cc-bridge_checker`, and
  `agentroles.cc-bridge_round_checker`.

Current targeted verification:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=lib pytest -q test/test_orchestrator_rolepack.py
```

Result:

```text
7 passed
```

This verifies manifest translation, CC_BRIDGE adapter provider coverage, skill
projection paths, shared authority-rule presence, required templates, and the
shared round-result contract.
