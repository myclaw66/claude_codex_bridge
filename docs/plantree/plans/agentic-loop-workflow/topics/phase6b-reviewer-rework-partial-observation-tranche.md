# Phase 6B Reviewer-Rework / Partial Observation Tranche

Date: 2026-07-04
Status: PLAN-ONLY REVIEW PACKET / NOT LAUNCH APPROVAL / PHASE 6B UNCLAIMED

## Purpose

This packet turns the remaining Phase 6B claim blocker, "observe at least one
reviewer rework or partial result and classify it correctly", into a future
reviewable L5 observation tranche. It is planning material only. It does not
approve a provider run, does not request launch approval, and does not claim
Phase 6B readiness.

References:

- [Phase 1-6 acceptance goal](../goals/phase1-6-acceptance-goal.zh.md)
- [Phase 6B task-pack catalog](phase6-real-provider-lab-task-packs.md)
- [Frozen L1-L4 launch request](phase6b-l1-l4-launch-request-20260704.md)
- [Phase 6B launch checklist](phase6b-real-provider-lab-launch-checklist.md)
- [Phase 6B claim coverage matrix](phase6b-real-provider-claim-coverage-matrix.md)
- Reviewer2 L1-L4 doc-only acceptance:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/cc-bridge_source/.cc-bridge/cc-bridge-daemon/artifacts/text/completion-reply/job_c0fac249749e-art_85be7618d4844d01.txt`

## Boundary

- This tranche is separate from the frozen L1-L4 request and must not be
  appended to it without a new launch-specific reviewer verdict.
- It does not touch the worker1 static normalizer hardening lane
  `job_4697fb66db4e`.
- Any future execution must use a fresh external lab root, exact command
  shape, inherited current system provider environment, lab-local
  `AGENT_ROLES_STORE`, and explicit approval-to-run.
- No source-wrapper, `cc_bridge_test`, provider, L0-L5, or runtime command is
  authorized by this document.

## Candidate Tasks

The partial candidate is the recommended single-task tranche if a future launch
reviewer approves only one observation, because the acceptance goal requires
reviewer rework or partial, and partial can be bounded without relying on a
provider mistake. The reviewer-rework candidate remains a concrete alternate
or second task if the launch reviewer wants direct reviewer-rework evidence.

| Candidate | Task id | Expected route | Expected round result | Expected final status | Expected classification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Partial budget/source-gap observation | `phase6b-l5-partial-budget-source-gap` | `direct_execution` | `partial` | `partial` | `valid_non_success` |
| Reviewer bounded-rework observation | `phase6b-l5-reviewer-bounded-rework-contract` | `direct_execution` | `pass` after one accepted rework, or `reviewer_cannot_accept` if not accepted | `done` after accepted rework, otherwise `partial`, `replan_required`, or `blocked` | `pass` after accepted rework with `rework_attempt_count=1`; otherwise `valid_non_success` with explicit blocker evidence |

### Partial Candidate

Concrete fixture shape:

- Present file:
  `lab_docs/l5_partial_existing_summary.md`.
- Intentionally absent dependency:
  `lab_docs/l5_partial_required_source.md`.
- Task packet asks the worker to update the existing summary from the required
  source file, but explicitly forbids inventing missing source content.
- Execution contract says that if the source is absent, the worker must update
  only the safe completed portion, return `partial`, list completed and
  unfinished steps, and cite the missing source as blocker evidence.

Expected observation:

- `observed_route=direct_execution`.
- `round_result=partial`.
- `final_status=partial`.
- `classification=valid_non_success`.
- `partial_completed_steps` contains the existing-summary inspection/update
  step.
- `partial_unfinished_steps` contains the missing-source synchronization step.
- `human_diagnosis_summary` states that partial is valid because the missing
  source was bounded and not invented.

### Reviewer-Rework Candidate

Concrete fixture shape:

- Present file:
  `lab_docs/l5_reviewer_contract_note.md`.
- Task packet requires three exact markers in that file:
  `scope_boundary`, `verification_evidence`, and `claim_boundary`.
- Execution contract requires the worker reply to cite both `task_packet` and
  `execution_contract`, report the exact changed file, and include focused
  verification evidence.
- Reviewer contract requires rejection if any marker, citation, or verification
  evidence is missing. One reviewer-requested rework cycle is allowed.

Expected observation:

- `observed_route=direct_execution`.
- `rework_attempt_count=1` if the reviewer requests rework.
- Accepted rework: `round_result=pass`, `final_status=done`,
  `classification=pass`, and `reviewer_rework_observed=true`.
- Not accepted after the bounded rework: `round_result=reviewer_cannot_accept`
  or `partial`, `final_status=partial`, `replan_required`, or `blocked`, and
  `classification=valid_non_success` only when blocker evidence is explicit.
- If the first worker pass is accepted with no rework, the row may be `pass`
  but it does not satisfy the reviewer-rework/partial claim requirement; the
  launch supervisor should proceed to the partial candidate if approved.

## Required Artifacts

Future launch approval must name the exact output root before execution. The
following paths are schematic and must be bound by that future request:

```text
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/command_log.jsonl
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/rows/phase6b_l5_reviewer_rework_partial_evidence_rows.jsonl
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/reports/phase6b_l5_reviewer_rework_partial_b7.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/task_packet.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/execution_contract.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/orchestration_notes.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/worker_reply.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/reviewer_verdict.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/round_summary.md
```

Reviewer-rework rows additionally require:

```text
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/reviewer_rework_request.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/rework_reply.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/reviewer_final_verdict.md
```

Partial rows additionally require:

```text
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/partial_evidence.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/completed_steps.md
$PHASE6B_L5_ROOT/supervisor_imports/<task_id>/unfinished_steps.md
```

## Required B7 Row Fields

Every row must include the shared task-pack fields:

```text
task_id
complexity_level
provider_mix
expected_route
observed_route
route_decision_correct
required_artifacts_present
ask_reachability
detailer_activated_expected
detailer_activated_observed
worker_reviewer_ask_success
reviewer_contract_citation
round_result
final_status
cleanup_result
runtime_residue
role_boundary_violations
authority_write_violations
classification
human_diagnosis_summary
```

These L5 fields are also required:

```text
observation_type
failure_domain
rework_attempt_count
rework_attempt_limit
reviewer_rework_observed
reviewer_rework_request_path
reviewer_final_verdict_path
partial_observed
partial_completed_steps
partial_unfinished_steps
partial_reason
provider_format_drift
busy_retain_observed
topology_dispatch_absent
topology_communication_dsl_absent
provider_reply_authority_parsing_absent
release_blockers
release_incomplete_agents
```

Classification rules:

- `partial` with explicit completed and unfinished steps is
  `valid_non_success`.
- Accepted reviewer rework with exactly one rework attempt is `pass`.
- Reviewer cannot accept after the bounded rework is `valid_non_success` only
  when the row includes a concrete blocker, final reviewer verdict, and cleanup
  evidence.
- Missing artifacts, vague partials, hidden retries, unbounded reviewer
  rejection loops, provider text treated as authority, or unbounded runtime
  residue are not valid non-success.

## Reviewer Contract

The reviewer must cite both `task_packet` and `execution_contract`. The
reviewer must reject hidden fallback, scope shrink, fake success, missing
verification evidence, missing contract markers, or invented missing source
content. The reviewer must not mark partial work `done`.

Bounded rework limit:

- Maximum reviewer-requested rework cycles: `1`.
- A second reviewer rejection stops the task and must be classified from the
  evidence; it must not trigger an automatic hidden retry.
- The B7 row must record `rework_attempt_count` even when it is `0`.

## Cleanup And Residue Expectations

- Dynamic `coder` and `code_reviewer` agents are released only after
  `round_summary` import and idle proof.
- Resident roles stay mounted.
- `cleanup_result=released` is expected for clean rows.
- `cleanup_result=release_incomplete` is allowed only with explicit bounded
  `release_blockers` / `release_incomplete_agents`, such as `parked`,
  `drained`, `retained_busy`, or inherited-provider-home safety evidence.
- No released dynamic agent may remain in `.cc-bridge/cc-bridge.config`, desired topology,
  observed topology, or process/status evidence without an explicit blocker.
- Mainline evidence must not contain topology communication DSL fields,
  `topology_dispatch.json`, or provider-reply authority parsing.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before the next task and classify from evidence if any of these occur:

- future approval-to-run does not name the exact root, task tranche, and command
  shape;
- source-wrapper root or provider-home isolation is invalid;
- route differs from the launch-approved expected route;
- required `task_packet`, `execution_contract`, reviewer verdict, or
  `round_summary` artifact is missing;
- reviewer omits the required contract citation;
- rework attempts exceed the `1` attempt limit;
- partial completed/unfinished steps are empty or vague;
- provider reply text mutates authority state;
- topology dispatch or topology communication DSL appears in mainline evidence;
- cleanup leaves unbounded runtime residue.

## Reviewable Normalizer Shape

Status: PLAN-ONLY NORMALIZER SKETCH / DO NOT RUN.

Future launch approval must bind the exact root. Proposed root for the first
L5 observation tranche:

```text
/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/phase6-real-lab-l5-reviewer-rework-partial-20260704
```

Exact normalization command shape for future reviewer approval:

```bash
# DO NOT RUN until an L5 launch-specific reviewer approves the exact root and tranche.

## Future Launch Boundary

This packet is ready to be reviewed as planning input only. A later launch
request must choose the exact candidate task or ordered tranche, bind concrete
paths, include the command and normalizer shape, and ask explicitly for
approval-to-run. Until that happens, Phase 6B remains unclaimed and no runtime
command is approved.
