# Agentic Loop Workflow Plan

Date: 2026-06-24

## Purpose

Design a CC_BRIDGE-native multi-agent workflow loop that further reduces the burden
on the `frontdesk` group. In this model, `frontdesk` remains the user-facing boundary and
escalation surface, while planning, execution-document maintenance, task
decomposition, dynamic worker-team activation, loop monitoring, recovery, and
plan-tree synchronization are handled by separate roles under a scripted state
machine.

The basic design premise is to combine a simple, stable program kernel with
flexible agent intelligence. Scripts enforce hard constraints, identity,
state, locks, indexes, and commit rules. Agents provide semantic understanding,
planning, review, diagnosis, and human-readable documents.

The direction borrows Trellis' durable-state idea, where workflow truth lives
outside the model conversation and is advanced through scripts rather than
free-form memory. It also borrows the Team Builder idea from AutoGen Studio:
teams, roles, handoffs, and termination conditions should be declared as
workflow objects rather than improvised in every run.

CC_BRIDGE should not copy Trellis' implicit provider-native subagent model. Because
CC_BRIDGE already has visible agents, `ask`, callbacks, panes, runtime status, and
daemon-owned communication state, this plan favors explicit, inspectable,
recoverable workflow loops.

## Scope

In scope:

- A user-facing `frontdesk` group that only handles user discussion, macro-task
  intake, confirmations, final reporting, and unrecoverable escalation.
- A planner that maintains long-term plan-tree state, compact plan brief,
  macro task publication, roadmap/evidence hygiene, and readiness
  recommendations without carrying implementation detail.
- A task detailer role that is resident and visible in the V1 `cc-bridge-user`
  topology, but is semantically immaculate and activated with fresh context only
  when orchestrator triage requires detailed execution refinement; it turns
  macro task refs into task-scoped detail docs and a detail packet, then
  returns normal outputs to orchestrator and macro drift back to planner.
- A deterministic loop runner that reads short-term workflow state and starts
  or advances execution loops without relying on one agent's conversation
  memory.
- An orchestrator role that decomposes a ready execution task into bounded
  work items, selects required execution agents, proposes mount topology for
  CC_BRIDGE scripts to validate/commit/reconcile, and coordinates normal
  worker/reviewer/detailer collaboration through `ask`; its pane may be
  resident for observability, but each task or round activation must be fresh.
- A dynamic agent lifecycle layer where the V1 default visible baseline is
  four panes, `cc-bridge_frontdesk + cc-bridge_task_detailer` in `cc-bridge-user` and
  `cc-bridge_planner + cc-bridge_orchestrator` in `cc-bridge-plan`, while execution and
  round-review roles can be loaded and released after idle/evidence gates
  through topology or lifecycle reconciliation. Visible baseline membership is
  not a context-retention grant: `task_detailer` and `orchestrator` still follow
  immaculate fresh-activation rules.
- Dynamic execution nodes, each defaulting to a flat `worker + checker`
  structure. More complex node-internal teams are deferred until the work item
  cannot be safely split by orchestrator.
- Checker as an independent quality gate that designs node-level verification,
  audits worker output against the original design, and rejects hidden
  fallback, degradation, scope shrinkage, or false success.
- Partial execution semantics where non-converged nodes freeze only their
  dependent branch while unrelated sibling work drains to completion.
- A round-level checker that verifies the whole loop round after node work is
  drained, using planner-defined verification contracts and the actual
  orchestrator dependency graph.
- An inner monitor layer that watches loop health, `ask`/callback status,
  node heartbeats, artifacts, timeouts, and communication anomalies.
- A clarification broker path that receives stage-level candidate questions
  from planner group, filters or defaults non-blocking items, and sends only
  curated user-facing question references to `frontdesk`.
- Scripted state transitions so agents can propose progress but CC_BRIDGE-owned
  commands write authority state.
- Script-owned plan packets and runtime lists: durable Markdown records live
  under plan-tree, while high-frequency loop state lives under `.cc-bridge/runtime`
  and is updated only through CC_BRIDGE command surfaces.
- Context-purity boundaries that keep volatile execution detail out of `frontdesk`
  and out of long-term plan-tree files unless it becomes durable evidence,
  decision material, or a blocker.
- Team-spec style declarations for roles, handoffs, termination conditions,
  escalation conditions, and per-loop limits.
- Plan-tree synchronization only at durable boundaries such as accepted plans,
  decisions, evidence, blockers, and completion.

Out of scope:

- Making `frontdesk` a hidden central executor.
- Letting worker agents freely modify authoritative loop state without a
  scripted transition.
- Replacing cc-bridge-daemon, dispatcher, message bureau, or provider completion authority.
- Treating the inner monitor as a business-task decision maker.
- Keeping high-frequency loop events in committed plan-tree Markdown.
- Allowing unbounded agent chains, unbounded recovery loops, or unbounded
  dynamic node creation.
- Automatically publishing releases, deleting files, or performing destructive
  repair without the existing user-confirmation and release gates.

| `frontdesk` group | User conversation, scope confirmation, final summary, escalation handling | Direct business implementation or internal loop micromanagement |
| planner | Macro planning artifacts, global Roadmap Graph, plan brief, serial/parallel branches, priorities, cross-lane dependencies, high-level acceptance, readiness recommendation, macro adjustment and integration review | Detail design body maintenance, detailed implementation packet maintenance, runtime worker lifecycle, direct detailer/worker dispatch, concurrent writing of another planner scope, or final authority over code correctness |
| `task_detailer` | Task-local refinement, task-scoped detail docs, source evidence, detail packet, stable summary backfill, task-local clarification | Roadmap/status authority, runtime dispatch, worker/reviewer control, or long-term user conversation |
| clarification broker | Candidate-question filtering, user-question artifact, answer normalization | Direct user conversation or execution-loop activation |
| planner stewardship mode / `cc_bridge plan` scripts | Plan-tree consistency, short-term progress state, evidence linking, authoritative task/index/status writes through scripts | Business implementation, provider repair, daemon supervision, or bypassing script validation |
| loop runner | Deterministic state-machine execution and loop start/advance | Semantic product decisions |
| orchestrator | One activation owns coupled work slicing, dependencies, logical role assignment, worker packets, review/integration intent, and bounded semantic replanning | Long-term plan authority, concrete agent binding, physical `ask` submission, topology mutation, or runtime authority writes |
| execution node | Bounded `worker + checker` implementation and node-quality gate | Global task routing, hidden degradation, or durable plan mutation |
| round checker | Whole-round verification plan and execution | Product scope changes, implementation fixes, or authoritative state writes |
| inner monitor | Health observation, timeout/anomaly escalation, communication checks | Product judgment or arbitrary repair |
